extension for text WebUI

It has to be in extensions/VirtualLora

(it has hardcoded folders so don;t change VirtualLora)

This is to create your own collection folders to sort hundreds of LOras the way you want

You create the tree by simpply writing a template txt file (collection set). You can have many of these collection sets and each will have an root items (like a virtual folder) then the actual LORA folders.
